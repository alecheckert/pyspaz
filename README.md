# pyspaz

`pyspaz` is a module for analyzing live cell single molecule tracking data. The package includes localization, tracking, visualization, masking, quality control, and analysis utilities.

As `pyspaz` is still in active development, the recommended means of installation is

`python setup.py develop`

which will track changes in the source files.

## Dependencies

`pyspaz` requires the `nd2reader`, `tifffile`, and `munkres` packages. 

## Tutorial

For an example of how to run a basic localization and tracking analysis, see the `examples/localization_and_tracking.ipynb` notebook.
